15) API-Specific Vectors → “Shadow Endpoints Hunt”
Dive into API documentation or inferred schemas (e.g., via OpenAPI if exposed). Look for undocumented or deprecated fields that reference objects indirectly, like "parentId" or "relatedEntity." Test by chaining references: if /api/v1/item/{id} is secure, try /api/v1/item/{id}/subitem/{subId} where subId belongs to another user. Focus on polymorphic objects where type-switching (e.g., from "post" to "privateMessage") bypasses checks.

Self-check: Have I enumerated API versions and compared security across them?

16) Frontend Leakage Exploitation → “Client-Side Whispers”
Inspect JavaScript bundles for hardcoded object maps or metadata leaks, such as serialized user data in global variables or event listeners. Use this to predict valid IDs (e.g., extract patterns from rendered lists) and tamper with client-side routing that proxies to backend. For SPAs, manipulate Vue/React state to force unauthorized fetches.

Self-check: Did I search JS files for regex like /id:\s*["']?[a-z0-9-]{8,}/ to harvest potential references?

17) Permission Inheritance Flaws → “Hierarchical Havoc”
In apps with tree-like structures (folders, comments threads, org hierarchies), test if child objects inherit weak parent permissions. Tamper with root IDs to access entire subtrees, or orphan an object by changing its parent to one you control, exposing data via inheritance chains.

Self-check: For any nested resource, did I attempt to reparent it or access siblings across owners?

18) Token-Based Blind Spots → “Ephemeral Echoes”
Examine JWTs or session tokens for embedded object references (e.g., userId in claims). Craft requests where you swap tokens mid-flow or use expired/revoked tokens that still grant partial access due to caching. Target OAuth scopes that are overly broad, allowing ID tampering within the same auth context.

Self-check: Have I decoded tokens and tested if tampering claims affects object resolution?

19) Search Engine Integration Gaps → “Indexed Shadows”
If the site uses Elasticsearch or similar, probe for exposed indices via /_search endpoints or query parameters like "filter_path." Leak object IDs from aggregations or facets, then use them in direct access calls. Check if search results include metadata not filtered by ownership.

Self-check: Did I craft queries that return buckets or hits from unauthorized scopes?

20) Real-Time Collaboration Cracks → “Sync Sinkholes”
For apps with WebSockets or polling (e.g., chat, docs), subscribe to channels with tampered room/channel IDs. Monitor for broadcast messages that leak object data without per-subscriber checks. Test if leaving/joining a shared space allows lingering access to historical objects.

Self-check: Using browser console, did I emit events with forged IDs and observe responses?

21) Backup and Restore Loopholes → “Ghost Archives”
Hunt for endpoints like /backup/download or /restore/import that handle serialized data. Inject foreign object IDs into restore payloads or extract from backups if format is guessable (e.g., JSON dumps). Often, these bypass runtime checks in favor of bulk processing.

Self-check: Have I attempted to upload a modified backup with mixed ownership data?

22) Metadata Manipulation → “Side-Channel Sculpting”
Target endpoints that handle object metadata separately (e.g., /tags/add?id= or /labels/update). If metadata isn't ownership-checked, use it to infer or expose sensitive objects, like tagging a private item to make it searchable or visible in feeds.

Self-check: Did changing metadata on a tampered ID reveal existence or content indirectly?

23) Cross-Service Federation → “Boundary Blurs”
In federated systems (e.g., SSO across domains), tamper with federated IDs (like federatedUserId). Test if service A’s secure check doesn’t propagate to service B, allowing IDOR via linked accounts or shared auth providers.

Self-check: For multi-domain apps, did I switch origins while keeping the same ID?

24) AI/ML Feature Fuzzing → “Algorithmic Anomalies”
If the site has recommendation engines or AI-driven feeds, input tampered IDs as seeds to see if the model outputs unauthorized data (e.g., "similar to {victimId}"). Probe for endpoints like /predict?inputId= where predictions leak features from private objects.

Self-check: Have I fed known unauthorized IDs into AI queries and analyzed outputs for leaks?

25) Custom Protocol Probes → “Exotic Entrances”
Beyond HTTP, check for gRPC, WebRTC, or custom protocols if hinted in network traffic. Decompile or sniff to find object references in binary payloads, then replay with modifications. These often lack the maturity of REST checks.

Self-check: Did I use tools like Wireshark to capture and alter non-HTTP traffic?

26) User Role Simulation → “Persona Pivots”
Create multiple test accounts with varying roles (e.g., free vs paid, viewer vs editor). Systematically swap IDs across roles, focusing on escalation paths where a low-priv user can access high-priv objects via misconfigured ACLs.

Self-check: Have I mapped role-specific endpoints and cross-tested IDs between them?

27) Data Export Format Tricks → “Structured Surprises”
When exporting data (e.g., XML, JSON), include tampered filters or IDs in the request to embed unauthorized data. Parse the output for nested objects that slip through due to serializer oversights.

Self-check: Did I request exports with query params like include=related&ownerId=victim?

28) Event Sourcing Weaknesses → “Timeline Tampering”
In event-driven architectures, query event streams (/events?aggregateId=) with foreign IDs. If replays or aggregates don't enforce ownership per event, reconstruct unauthorized histories.

Self-check: Have I requested event logs for IDs outside my scope and rebuilt objects from them?

29) Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities → “Modular Mayhem”
If the app supports plugins (e.g., WordPress-like), test third-party endpoints for IDOR in hooks or callbacks. Often, core checks aren't applied to extension routes.

Self-check: Did I identify and tamper IDs in plugin-specific paths like /plugins/foo/action?id=?

30) Philosophical Extension: “Socratic Scrutiny”
Adopt a questioning lens: For every object, ask "What if this ID was never meant to be direct?" Reverse-engineer implied indirections, like hashing IDs client-side before submission, and break them. This mindset turns routine checks into creative deconstructions.

Mini practice seeds (fresh angles):
- In any search bar, append &userId=victim or &scope=all to broaden results.
- For image galleries, swap src attributes in DOM and force a reload to trigger backend fetches.
- On profile pages, inspect for data-user-id attrs and inject them into unrelated forms.
- Try appending ?debug=true or ?bypass=1 to endpoints; legacy flags sometimes disable checks.
- In forms, add duplicate params like id=yourId&id=victimId and see which one processes.
